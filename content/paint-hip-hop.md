[Paint Hip Hop](https://www.painthiphop.com/) is a hip hop music app. It was the first application I built and was influential in terms of my experience with web development and my confidence in front of code.

A user shares a song which builds playlists for those who follow that user. It uses a basic Twitter follow model.  

Popular tracks earn users rep points (check the shades). Rep points are achieved by people liking the shared song.  

When Paint Hip Hop launched in mid 2012, it had a fair bit of traffic (at least what I was expecting for a side project) that reached roughly 1,000 unique visitors for the month and 20 concurrent users at its peak.  

Paint Hip Hop is built with Ruby on Rails. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/rparang/jams).  

I had contracted out the logo design on Dribbble, which turned out to be a surprisingly nice experience. The designer did a [case study](https://www.behance.net/gallery/Paint-The-Town/10297781).
